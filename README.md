## Features of React
- IT uses a virtual DOM to improve performance
Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. It allows React to update only the parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire DOM.
- It uses a component-based architecture
Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build complex user interfaces. They can be nested, managed, and handled independently.
- It uses JSX syntax
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of your components.
- It has a unidirectional data flow
In React, data flows in one direction, from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data is being passed and helps to prevent bugs
